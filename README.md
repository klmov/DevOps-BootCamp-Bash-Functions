# DevOps BootCamp: Bash Functions

In this task you need to create some functions.

> :warning: Please, don't call your functions in `./functions.sh` file. This would breake unit-tests. Create a new file and do `source ./functions.sh` there to test your functions.

## Pow Task

Develop a `pow()` function that takes two arguments `(a, b)` and raises the first argument to the power of the second `(a^b)`.

### Check

`pow 2 3` -> `8`

`pow 2 5` -> `32`

## Shortest string function

Develop the `shortest()` function, which can take an unlimited number of arguments(strings) and output the shortest argument.

### Check

`shortest "This" "is" "Bash" "Functions" "Task"`

`is`

If there are more than two arguments, output each string on a new line. In an order they are passed to function.

`shortest "Java" "Bash" "Python"`

`Java`

`Bash`

## Log function

Develop a `print_log()` function that takes a string as an argument and outputs the same string with the date at the beginning.
In order for the automatic check to work, the string must be in this format: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTES`

`print_log "Hello World!"` -> `[2022-05-10 13:04] Hello World!`

`print_log "Hello Bash!"` -> `[2022-05-10 13:10] Hello Bash!`
